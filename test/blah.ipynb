      "Okay, so the user asked, \"What's 1+1?\" That's a pretty basic math question. Let me think about how to approach this.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I know that 1+1 is one of the simplest arithmetic operations. In basic arithmetic, adding 1 and 1 together should give the result 2. But maybe the user is testing if I can handle a very straightforward question or if there's a trick here. Sometimes people might phrase simple questions in a way that seems complex, but in this case, it's pretty direct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, could there be a different interpretation? Like in some contexts, such as binary or other number systems? Let me check. In binary, 1+1 equals 10, which is 2 in decimal. But the question doesn't specify a base, so by default, it's probably in decimal. Also, the user might just be looking for the standard answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another angle: maybe they're expecting a joke or a play on words. For example, in some riddles, 1+1 might refer to something else, like \"a pair\" or \"two.\" But the question is phrased as a straightforward math problem, so I think the answer is 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there's any ambiguity in the question. The user wrote \"What's 1+1?\" with a question mark, so it's definitely asking for an answer. No hidden meaning here. The most logical and correct answer is 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure there are no alternative mathematical interpretations. In standard arithmetic, addition is commutative and associative, so 1+1=2. There's no need to overcomplicate it. Unless the user is in a specific context like modular arithmetic, but again, that's not indicated here.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer is 2. I should present it clearly and confirm that it's the correct result in standard arithmetic.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The result of $1 + 1$ is **2**. In standard arithmetic, adding one and one together yields two. This is the most straightforward and universally accepted answer unless specified otherwise (e.g., in different number systems or contexts). \n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:** 2\n"
