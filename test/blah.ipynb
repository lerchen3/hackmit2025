      "Okay, the user is asking \"What's 1+1?\" That seems straightforward, but maybe they want a deeper explanation. Let me think. In basic arithmetic, 1+1 is 2. But perhaps they're looking for a more detailed breakdown. I should start by confirming the standard answer. Then, maybe explain the concept of addition. Wait, are there any alternative interpretations? Like in different number systems or contexts? For example, in binary, 1+1 is 10, which is 2 in decimal. But the question doesn't specify a context, so the default is probably base 10. Also, in some abstract algebra contexts, like modulo arithmetic, 1+1 could be different, but that's more advanced. The user might just want the simple answer. Let me make sure to mention the basic arithmetic result first and then touch on other possibilities briefly. That way, it's comprehensive but not overwhelming. I should also check if there's any cultural or linguistic nuance I'm missing. The question is pretty direct, so I think the answer is straightforward. Just need to present it clearly.\n",
