quail_1,"We are given that the sum of the first $n$ cubes, $S_n = \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}$, leaves a remainder of 17 when divided by $n+5$. This implies the congruence:  
$$
\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}
$$  
Multiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the denominator yields:  
$$
n^2(n+1)^2 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5}
$$  
Since $n \equiv -5 \pmod{n+5}$ and $n+1 \equiv -4 \pmod{n+5}$, substitute these values into the left-hand side:  
$$
(-5)^2(-4)^2 = 25 \cdot 16 = 400
$$  
Thus, $400 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5}$, which implies $400 - 68 = 332$ is divisible by $n+5$. So $n+5 \mid 332$. The positive divisors of $332 = 2^2 \cdot 83$ are $1, 2, 4, 83, 166, 332$. Given that the remainder is 17, the modulus $n+5$ must exceed 17, ruling out $1, 2, 4$. The valid values are $n+5 = 83, 166, 332$, yielding $n = 78, 161, 327$. The sum of these $n$ values is $78 + 161 + 327 = 566$. Therefore, the sum of all such positive integers $n$ is $\boxed{566}$.",False,566
quail_2,"The sum of the first $ n $ cubes is $ S_n = \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} $. We are told that when $ S_n $ is divided by $ n+5 $, the remainder is $ 17 $, so $ S_n \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5} $. Multiplying both sides by $ 4 $ yields $ n^2(n+1)^2 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5} $. Since $ n \equiv -5 \pmod{n+5} $ and $ n+1 \equiv -4 \pmod{n+5} $, substituting gives $ (-5)^2(-4)^2 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5} $. Computing the left-hand side, $ 25 \cdot 16 = 400 $, so $ 400 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5} $. This implies $ 400 - 68 = 332 $ is divisible by $ n+5 $, meaning $ n+5 \mid 332 $. The positive divisors of $ 332 = 2^2 \cdot 83 $ are $ 1, 2, 4, 83, 166, 332 $. Since the remainder is $ 17 $, $ n+5 $ must exceed $ 17 $, so we discard $ 1, 2, 4 $. The valid values are $ n+5 = 83, 166, 332 $, corresponding to $ n = 78, 161, 327 $. Summing these values gives $ 78 + 161 + 327 = \boxed{566} $. This is the total of all such positive integers $ n $.",False,566
quail_3,"This allows us to pair terms symmetrically from $ 5^3 $ to $ n^3 $, canceling each pair modulo $ n+5 $. When $ n $ is even, the number of terms from $ 5^3 $ to $ n^3 $ is even, so all terms cancel completely in the sum modulo $ n+5 $. This leaves only $ 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = 100 $, and since the total sum must be congruent to $ 100 \pmod{n+5} $, we find $ n+5 \mid 83 $. Given that $ 83 $ is prime, the only positive divisor greater than $ 5 $ is $ 83 $, so $ n = 78 $. Now consider the case where $ n $ is odd. The middle term of the symmetric pairing is at $ \frac{n+5}{2} $, and the sum becomes $ 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + \left( \frac{n+5}{2} \right)^3 \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5} $. Letting $ k = \frac{n+5}{2} $, the congruence becomes $ k^2 + 83 \equiv 0 \pmod{2k} $. This implies $ 2k \mid k^2 + 83 $, and since $ 2k \mid k^2 $ only if $ k \mid k^2 $, it follows that $ k \mid 83 $. As $ 83 $ is prime, $ k = 1 $ or $ 83 $. The case $ k = 1 $ gives $ n = -3 $, which is invalid. The case $ k = 83 $ gives $ n = 2 \cdot 83 - 5 = 161 $. Therefore, the valid solutions are $ n = 78 $ and $ n = 161 $, and their sum is $ 78 + 161 = \boxed{239} $.",True,239
quail_4,"The cubic sum from $5^3$ to $n^3$ is considered modulo $n+5$. Observe that for any $a$, the expression $(5+a)^3 + (n-a)^3$ simplifies modulo $n+5$ to a difference of cubes that vanishes. This cancellation mechanism allows pairing symmetric terms around the midpoint of the sequence. When $n$ is even, the number of terms from $5$ to $n$ is even, so complete pairing occurs, leading to a total sum congruent to zero modulo $n+5$. The remaining part of the sum is then $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = 100$, which must satisfy $100 \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}$, implying $n+5$ divides $83$. Since $83$ is prime, the only possibility is $n+5 = 83$, so $n = 78$. When $n$ is odd, an unpaired middle term exists at position $\frac{n+5}{2}$, which introduces an extra cube term. The total sum becomes $17 + k^3$, where $k = \frac{n+5}{2}$, and this must be congruent to zero modulo $2k$. The condition $k^3 + 17 \equiv 0 \pmod{2k}$ implies $k$ divides $83$, so $k = 1$ or $83$. Only $k = 83$ yields a valid solution, giving $n = 2 \cdot 83 - 5 = 161$. The sum of all such $n$ is therefore $78 + 161 = \boxed{239}$.",True,239
quail_5,"Let $ S_n = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \cdots + n^3 $, which is known to satisfy $ S_n = \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^2 $. Given that $ S_n \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5} $, we substitute the closed-form expression to obtain:  
$$
\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}. $$  
In the modulus $ n+5 $, the congruence $ n \equiv -5 $ holds. Substituting $ n = -5 $ into the left-hand side yields:  
$$
\frac{(-5)^2(-5+1)^2}{4} = \frac{25 \cdot 16}{4} = 100. $$  
Thus, the expression simplifies modulo $ n+5 $ to $ 100 \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5} $. Rearranging gives $ 100 - 17 = 83 \equiv 0 \pmod{n+5} $, so $ n+5 \mid 83 $. Since $ 83 $ is prime, its positive divisors are $ 1 $ and $ 83 $. The remainder $ 17 $ implies $ n+5 > 17 $, ruling out $ n+5 = 1 $. The only viable solution is $ n+5 = 83 $, so $ n = 78 $. This value satisfies all given conditions, and as no other divisors meet the constraints, it is the unique solution. Therefore, the sum of all such $ n $ is $ \boxed{78} $.",False,78

This congruence allows us to pair terms in the sum $ 5^3 + 6^3 + \cdots + n^3 $ such that each pair cancels modulo $ n+5 $. If $ n $ is even, the number of terms from $ 5 $ to $ n $ is even, so complete pairing occurs and the entire sum vanishes modulo $ n+5 $. Thus, the original sum reduces to $ 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = 100 $, and we have $ 100 \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5} $, so $ n+5 \mid 83 $. Since $ 83 $ is prime, $ n+5 = 83 $, giving $ n = 78 $. If $ n $ is odd, the pairing leaves a central term unpaired. This term corresponds to $ \left( \frac{n+5}{2} \right)^3 $, since the midpoint of the interval from $ 5 $ to $ n $ is $ \frac{n+5}{2} $. Then the sum modulo $ n+5 $ becomes $ 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + \left( \frac{n+5}{2} \right)^3 \equiv 17 + k^3 \pmod{2k} $, where $ k = \frac{n+5}{2} $. Thus, $ 17 + k^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{2k} $, or $ k^3 + 17 \equiv 0 \pmod{2k} $, which implies $ k \mid 17 $. But $ k^3 + 17 \equiv 0 \pmod{2k} $ further forces $ k \mid 83 $, so $ k = 1 $ or $ k = 83 $. Testing $ k = 83 $ gives $ n = 2(83) - 5 = 161 $. Therefore, the sum of all valid $ n $ is $ 78 + 161 = \boxed{239} $.",True,239
quail_7,"Consider the sum $1^3 + 2^3 + \cdots + n^3$ modulo $n+5$. For the terms from $5^3$ to $n^3$, observe that $(5+a)^3 + (n-a)^3 \equiv (5+a)^3 - (n+5 - (n-a))^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{n+5}$, so these terms form symmetric pairs that cancel modulo $n+5$. When $n$ is even, the number of such terms is even, and pairing them all results in complete cancellation. The remaining terms are $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = 100$, which implies $100 \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}$, so $n+5$ divides $83$. Since $83$ is prime, the only positive divisor greater than $1$ is $83$, giving $n = 78$. When $n$ is odd, the middle term of the symmetric pairing is at $a = \frac{n-5}{2}$, corresponding to the cube $\left(\frac{n+5}{2}\right)^3$. In this case, the total sum modulo $n+5$ reduces to $17 + k^3$, where $k = \frac{n+5}{2}$, so $k^3 + 17 \equiv 0 \pmod{2k}$. This congruence implies $k$ divides $83$, so $k = 1$ or $83$. The case $k = 1$ gives $n = -3$, invalid. The case $k = 83$ gives $n = 161$. Thus, the possible values of $n$ are $78$ and $161$, and their sum is $\boxed{239}$.",True,239

This implies the congruence $ \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5} $. Multiplying both sides by 4, we obtain $ n^2(n+1)^2 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5} $. In this modulus, $ n \equiv -5 $ and $ n+1 \equiv -4 $. Substituting these equivalences yields $ (-5)^2(-4)^2 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5} $, which simplifies to $ 25 \cdot 16 = 400 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5} $. Rearranging, we find $ 400 - 68 = 332 \equiv 0 \pmod{n+5} $, so $ n+5 $ divides 332. The positive divisors of 332, which factors as $ 2^2 \cdot 83 $, are $ 1, 2, 4, 83, 166, 332 $. Since $ n+5 $ must exceed the remainder 17, we discard $ 1, 2, 4 $. The remaining candidates are $ n+5 = 83, 166, 332 $, leading to $ n = 78, 161, 327 $.

This implies

If $n$ is odd, the middle term at $a = \frac{n+5}{2}$ remains unpaired. Letting $k = \frac{n+5}{2}$, the sum becomes $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + k^3 \equiv 17 + k^3 \pmod{2k}$. This yields $k^3 + 17 \equiv 0 \pmod{2k}$, or equivalently $k^2 + 83 \equiv 0 \pmod{2k}$, which implies $k$ divides $83$. The positive divisors of $83$ are $1$ and $83$, so $k = 83$ gives $n = 2(83) - 5 = 161$. The sum of all valid $n$ is therefore $78 + 161 = \boxed{239}$.",True,239

We begin with the identity for the sum of cubes:  
$$
1^3 + 2^3 + \cdots + n^3 = \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}. $$  
Given that this sum leaves a remainder of 17 when divided by $ n + 5 $, we have  
$$
\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}. $$  
Multiplying both sides by 4 preserves the congruence, yielding  
$$
n^2(n+1)^2 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5}. $$  
Thus, $ n^2(n+1)^2 - 68 $ is divisible by $ n+5 $, or equivalently,  
$$
n^4 + 2n^3 + n^2 - 68 \equiv 0 \pmod{n+5}. $$  
This implies that $ n+5 $ divides the polynomial $ n^4 + 2n^3 + n^2 - 68 $. Performing polynomial division gives  
$$
\frac{n^4 + 2n^3 + n^2 - 68}{n+5} = n^3 - 3n^2 + 16n - 80 + \frac{332}{n+5}. $$

$$
\left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2 \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}. $$  
In this congruence, since $n \equiv -5 \pmod{n+5}$, we substitute $n = -5$ into the expression:  
$$
\left(\frac{(-5)(-4)}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{20}{2}\right)^2 = 10^2 = 100. $$  
Thus, the left-hand side simplifies to $100$ modulo $n+5$, yielding

Since $k \mid k^3$, it follows that $k \mid 17$, but more carefully, the congruence $k^3 + 17 \equiv 0 \pmod{2k}$ implies $k$ divides $83$. Hence $k = 1$ or $83$. The case $k = 1$ gives $n = -3$, invalid. $k = 83$ gives $n = 2(83) - 5 = 161$. Adding both valid solutions, $78 + 161 = \boxed{239}$.",True,239

This implies $n+5$ divides $83$, so $n+5 = 83$, yielding $n = 78$. If $n$ is odd, the middle term at $a = \frac{n+5}{2}$ remains unpaired.

Thus, $k^3 \equiv -17 \pmod{2k}$, and since $k^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{k}$, it follows that $k \mid 83$. The divisors of $83$ are $1$ and $83$, so $k = 83$ gives $n = 2(83) - 5 = 161$.

$$

\left( \frac{(-5)(-5+1)}{2} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{(-5)(-4)}{2} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{20}{2} \right)^2 = 10^2 = 100. $$
Thus, the left-hand side simplifies to 100 modulo $ n+5 $, so the congruence becomes:
$$
100 \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}. $$
This is equivalent to $ 100 - 17 = 83 \equiv 0 \pmod{n+5} $, meaning $ n+5 $ divides 83. As 83 is prime, its positive divisors are only 1 and 83. The remainder condition requires $ n+5 > 17 $, so $ n+5 = 1 $ is invalid. Only $ n+5 = 83 $ satisfies the inequality, giving $ n = 78 $. This is the only positive integer solution.

$$
\left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2 \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}. $$
Now, working modulo $n+5$, we note that $n \equiv -5$. Substituting this into the expression yields:
$$
\left(\frac{(-5)(-5+1)}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{(-5)(-4)}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{20}{2}\right)^2 = 10^2 = 100. $$
Thus, the congruence simplifies to $100 \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}$, which rearranges to $100 - 17 = 83 \equiv 0 \pmod{n+5}$. This implies that $n+5$ divides $83$. Since $83$ is prime, its positive divisors are only $1$ and $83$. Given that the remainder $17$ requires $n+5 > 17$, the case $n+5 = 1$ is invalid as it gives $n = -4$, not a positive integer.

Since $n \equiv -5 \pmod{n+5}$ and $n+1 \equiv -4 \pmod{n+5}$, we substitute to get $(-5)^2(-4)^2 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5}$. This simplifies to $25 \cdot 16 = 400 \equiv 68 \pmod{n+5}$, implying $400 - 68 = 332$ is divisible by $n+5$. Thus, $n+5$ divides 332. The positive divisors of 332 are $1, 2, 4, 83, 166, 332$. As the divisor must exceed the remainder 17, we discard $1$, $2$, and $4$, leaving $83$, $166$, and $332$. Solving for $n$ gives $n = 78$, $161$, and $327$, respectively.

This allows us to pair terms symmetrically around the center of the sequence from $5^3$ to $n^3$. When $n$ is even, the number of terms from $5^3$ to $n^3$ is even, so all can be grouped into such pairs, each summing to $0 \pmod{n+5}$. Thus, the sum reduces to $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = 100$. Therefore, $100 \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}$, implying $(n+5) \mid 83$. Since $83$ is prime, $n+5 = 83$, so $n = 78$. Now consider the case where $n$ is odd. The number of terms from $5^3$ to $n^3$ is still even, but an unpaired middle term arises: the cube of the midpoint, which is $\left(\frac{n+5}{2}\right)^3$.

For this to be an integer, $n+5$ must divide 332. The positive divisors of 332 greater than 17 (since the remainder is 17) are 83, 166, and 332. Thus, $n+5 \in \{83, 166, 332\}$, giving $n \in \{78, 161, 327\}$. Testing each, only $n = 78$ and $n = 161$ satisfy the original remainder condition.

Given that this sum divided by $n + 5$ leaves a remainder of 17, we express this congruence:

Multiplying both sides by 4 preserves the congruence, yielding:

Thus, $n^2(n+1)^2 - 68$ is divisible by $n + 5$, or equivalently:  
$$
n^4 + 2n^3 + n^2 - 68 \equiv 0 \pmod{n+5}. $$  
This implies that $n+5$ divides the quartic polynomial expression above. Performing polynomial division, we find:

This allows us to pair terms from $5^3$ to $n^3$ such that each pair sums to zero modulo $n+5$. When $n$ is even, the number of such terms is even, so all terms from $5^3$ to $n^3$ cancel out, leaving the sum $1^3+2^3+3^3+4^3 = 100$.

We are given that the sum $1^3 + 2^3 + \cdots + n^3$ is congruent to $17 \pmod{n+5}$, and we are to find all such $n$ satisfying this condition. Observe that for any $a$, the expression $(5+a)^3 + (n-a)^3$ satisfies $(5+a)^3 + (n-a)^3 \equiv (5+a)^3 - (n+5 - (n-a))^3 \equiv (5+a)^3 - (5+a)^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{n+5}$. Hence, terms in the sum from $5^3$ to $n^3$ can be paired symmetrically around $ \frac{n+5}{2} $, and each pair sums to a multiple of $n+5$. If $n$ is even, the number of such terms is even, so they fully pair and cancel modulo $n+5$. Thus, the sum reduces to $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = 100$, and $100 \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}$, so $n+5$ divides $83$. Since $83$ is prime, $n+5 = 83$, giving $n = 78$. If $n$ is odd, the middle term is at $a = \frac{n+5}{2}$, so the sum becomes $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + \left(\frac{n+5}{2}\right)^3 = 100 + k^3$, where $k = \frac{n+5}{2}$. This gives $100 + k^3 \equiv 17 \pmod{2k}$, or $k^3 + 83 \equiv 0 \pmod{2k}$. This implies $2k \mid (k^3 + 83)$, so $k \mid 83$.

However, $k^3 + 17 \equiv 0 \pmod{2k}$ forces $k$ to divide $83$, so $k = 83$. Then $n = 2(83) - 5 = 161$. The possible values are $n = 78$ and $n = 161$, and their sum is $\boxed{239}$.",True,239

Thus, $ S_n \equiv 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 \pmod{n+5} $. Computing this gives $ 1 + 8 + 27 + 64 = 100 $, so $ S_n \equiv 100 \pmod{n+5} $. Since the remainder is given as 17, we must have $ 100 \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5} $, which implies $ n+5 \mid 83 $. As 83 is prime, its only positive divisors are 1 and 83. To satisfy $ n+5 > 17 $, the divisor must be 83. Therefore, $ n+5 = 83 $, leading to $ n = 78 $. The solution is unique and consistent with all conditions.

Squaring this and simplifying modulo $ m $, we find

This gives $\frac{(-5)^2(-4)^2}{4} = \frac{25 \cdot 16}{4} = 100$. Thus, the left-hand side is congruent to $100$ modulo $n+5$, leading to $100 \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}$. Simplifying, we find $83 \equiv 0 \pmod{n+5}$, so $n+5$ must divide $83$. Since $83$ is prime, its positive divisors are $1$ and $83$. The remainder $17$ implies $n+5 > 17$, ruling out $n+5 = 1$, which gives $n = -4$. The only valid solution is $n+5 = 83$, so $n = 78$.

Specifically, for $ k = 5 $ to $ n $, the term $ k^3 $ pairs with $ (n+5-k)^3 $, and since $ n+5-k \equiv -k \pmod{n+5} $, we have $ k^3 + (n+5-k)^3 \equiv k^3 + (-k)^3 = 0 \pmod{n+5} $.

n^4 + 2n^3 + n^2 - 68 \equiv 0 \pmod{n+5}. $$  
Thus, $n+5$ divides the polynomial $n^4 + 2n^3 + n^2 - 68$. Performing polynomial division gives:

100 \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5}. $$  
This implies $100 - 17 = 83 \equiv 0 \pmod{n+5}$, meaning $n+5$ divides $83$. As $83$ is prime, its positive divisors are only $1$ and $83$. The remainder $17$ requires $n+5 > 17$, so $n+5 = 1$ is invalid. The only viable option is $n+5 = 83$, leading to $n = 78$. This is the sole solution satisfying all conditions. Therefore, the sum of all such values of $n$ is $\boxed{78}$.",False,78
quail_723,"Let $S_n = 1^3 + 2^3 + \cdots + n^3$. We are interested in $S_n \mod (n+5)$. Observe that modulo $n+5$, we have $n \equiv -5$, $n-1 \equiv -6$, and in general $k \equiv -(k+5) \mod (n+5)$ for $k \le n-5$. This allows us to pair terms: $k^3 + (n+5-k)^3 \equiv k^3 + (-k)^3 = 0 \mod (n+5)$, provided $k \ge 5$ and $n+5-k \ge 5$. The pairing begins at $5^3$ and $n^3$, and continues up to the middle of the sequence. Each such pair sums to zero modulo $n+5$, so the entire sum from $5^3$ to $n^3$ vanishes modulo $n+5$. Thus, $S_n \equiv 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 \mod (n+5)$. Computing this gives $1 + 8 + 27 + 64 = 100$. Therefore, $S_n \equiv 100 \mod (n+5)$. Given that the remainder is 17, we must have $100 \equiv 17 \mod (n+5)$, so $n+5 \mid 83$. Since 83 is prime, its positive divisors are only 1 and 83. Since $n+5 > 17$ (as the modulus must exceed the remainder), the only possibility is $n+5 = 83$. Solving yields $n = 78$. This is the only solution satisfying all conditions. The answer is $\boxed{78}$.",False,78
quail_724,"Let the sum $ S_n = 1^3 + 2^3 + \cdots + n^3 $ be considered modulo $ n+5 $. Observing that $ k \equiv -(n+5-k) \pmod{n+5} $, we note that $ k^3 + (n+5-k)^3 \equiv k^3 + (-k)^3 = 0 \pmod{n+5} $. This pairing technique applies to terms from $ 5^3 $ to $ n^3 $, where $ k $ ranges from 5 to $ n $, but only if $ n+5-k $ remains in the same range. Since $ n \equiv -5 $, $ n-1 \equiv -6 $, etc. , we can systematically pair $ 5^3 $ with $ n^3 $, $ 6^3 $ with $ (n-1)^3 $, and so on. Each such pair satisfies $ k^3 + (n+5-k)^3 \equiv k^3 + (-k)^3 = 0 \pmod{n+5} $. As these pairs cover all terms from $ 5^3 $ through $ n^3 $, their combined sum is congruent to 0 modulo $ n+5 $. Thus, the entire sum reduces to the first four cubes: $ S_n \equiv 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 \pmod{n+5} $. Computing this: $ 1 + 8 + 27 + 64 = 100 $, so $ S_n \equiv 100 \pmod{n+5} $. Given that the remainder is 17, we conclude $ 100 \equiv 17 \pmod{n+5} $, implying $ n+5 \mid 83 $. Since 83 is prime and $ n+5 > 17 $, the only valid divisor is $ n+5 = 83 $, yielding $ n = 78 $. Hence, the unique solution is $ \boxed{78} $.",False,78
quail_725,"This congruence allows us to pair terms symmetrically from $5^3$ to $n^3$, leading to cancellation under modulo $n+5$. When $n$ is even, the number of terms from $5^3$ to $n^3$ is even, so complete pairing results in the sum being congruent to zero modulo $n+5$. Hence, the total sum $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = 100$ must be congruent to $17$ modulo $n+5$, implying $n+5$ divides $83$. The only positive divisor of $83$ in this context is $83$ itself, so $n = 78$. If $n$ is odd, the middle term at position $\frac{n+5}{2}$ remains unpaired. Letting $k = \frac{n+5}{2}$, the sum reduces to $17 + k^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{2k}$, which implies $k^3 \equiv -17 \pmod{2k}$. Simplifying yields $k^2 + 83 \equiv 0 \pmod{2k}$, so $k$ divides $83$. Since $83$ is prime, $k = 1$ or $83$, leading to $n = 2(83) - 5 = 161$ upon substitution. The valid values of $n$ are thus $78$ and $161$, and their sum is $78 + 161 = \boxed{239}$. }.",True,239
quail_726,"We begin with the well-known identity for the sum of cubes:

Thus,

quail_728,"We are told that the sum of the first $n$ cubes, given by $S_n = \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}$, leaves a remainder of 17 when divided by $n+5$.
